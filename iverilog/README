This directory contains a version of the "bad" clock domain crossing.
It uses a narrower count in order to see the failures with shorter
runs when using iverilog (rather than a Gowin FPGA) to run.

To try this on Linux (e.g. Ubuntu 22.04) you must install iverilog
and gtkwave thus:

  sudo apt install iverilog gtwave

I don't know about Windows.

Then "make" will build and simulate the verilog creating file waveform.vcd
which can be viewed by

  gtkwave waveform.vcd

to view the signals.  Use these steps in gtkwave:

1.  Click on tb_bad on the left.
2.  Then, right click on it and select recurse import/append and
    append all signals.
3.  Click on the zoom out icon many times until you see signals
    changing
4.  Scroll right and left and view the signals.
