This directory contains a project for the Tang Nano 9K FPGA
development board that shows both a very bad and a good design for
passing data from one clock domain to another.

The good design uses the Gowin FIFO soft IP block.

You can use the Gowin to IDE to enable either the good or bad design
file.

When working, the Tang Nano 9K LEDs blink in a counting pattern.

Build and run with the Gowin IDE.
